# Hi, I'm Dev Goldy <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

#### *(aka 'Jassim', aka 'TGP (The Golden Pro)', aka 'whatever the f you want to call me')*

### I'm a 16 year old that self taught himself Python. I'm most comfortable with python but I'm hoping to soon expand to JavaScript, C# and Java. At the early beginning of my Python journey I coded apps like Nova Hub(DON'T look at the source code it's a complete mess) which really highlighted my coding flaws and mistakes but today I've fixed many of those mistakes and I'm constantly working to fix more. Now I'm currently developing/maintaining repo's such as [NovaUniverse.py](https://github.com/NovaUniverse/NovaUniverse.py) and [Goldy Bot V3](https://github.com/TGP-Projects/Goldy-Bot-V3), a sequal to Goldy Bot V2 that I really can't wait to realease the source code for as I've made many improvements to my code ever since the last.

### I've done a bit of app development in the past, started recently experimenting with Javascript frontend, python backend apps and their fun to develop. I'm quite confident with developing python discord bots but there's still a lot of learning ahead of me, like example in the web development sector. I'll tell you one thing though... I'm making my way up there.âš¡

***One day I'll develop a game... well guess you got to follow me until that day comes...***
