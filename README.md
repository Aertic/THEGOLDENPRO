# Hi, I'm Dev Goldy <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

#### *(aka 'Jassim', aka 'TGP (The Golden Pro)', aka 'whatever the f you want to call me')*

### I'm a 16 year old that self taught himself Python. I'm most comfortable with python but I'm hoping to soon expand to JavaScript, C# and Java. At the early beginning of my Python journey I coded apps like Nova Hub(which is a complete mess DON'T look at the code). Now I'm currently developing and maintaining [NovaUniverse.py](https://github.com/NovaUniverse/NovaUniverse.py) and [Goldy Bot V3](https://github.com/TGP-Projects/Goldy-Bot-V3), a sequal to Goldy Bot V2 that I really can't wait to realease the source code for as I've made many improvements to my code ever since the last.

### I've done a bit of app development in the past, started recently experimenting with Javascript frontend and python backend apps. I'm quite confident with developing discord bots but there's still a lot of learning ahead of me like example in the web development sector. I'll tell you one thing though, I'm making my way up there.⚡ 

***One day I'll develop a game... well guess you got to follow me until that day comes...***
